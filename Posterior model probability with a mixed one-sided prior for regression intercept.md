# Model Setup
Consider a standard linear regression model for data $d_k$ = \{ $y_{i,k},x_{i1,k},...,x_{ip,k}$ \} $_{i=1}^{n}$:  

$$y_{i,k}=\beta_{0,k}+\beta_{1,k}x_{i1,k}+...+\beta_{p,k}x_{ip,k}+\varepsilon_{i,k}$$
 
with independent random errors $\varepsilon_{i,k} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. The assumption of independent model errors is not essential for our framework as models with more sophisticated assumptions on data dependence fit into this framework straightforwardly.
