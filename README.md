# RCF-unified-modeling-framework
This repository contains comprehensive supplementary documentation for the paper *Replication Crisis in Finance? A Unified Modeling Framework for Reconciling Pessimism and Optimism*. Specifically,
- The "Posterior Model Probability with The Mixed Prior" file contains detailed mathematical derivations of our proposed modeling framework.
- The "USA_INVESTMENT_MONTHLY_VW_CAP" file is retrived from [Global Factor Data](https://jkpfactors.com/factor-returns), which contains the U.S. market’s investment-theme portfolios constructed as capped, value-weighted monthly returns (Janurary, 1931 - Decomber, 2024)
- The "F-F_Research_Data_5_Factors_2x3" file is retrived from [Kenneth R. French’s data library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_5_factors_2x3.html), which contains monthly series (July, 1963 - Decomber, 2024) for the five Fama–French benchmark factors (MKT, SMB, HML, RMW, and CMA).
-  The "USA_INVESTMENT_MONTHLY_VW_CAP_1963_2024" file is merged from "USA_INVESTMENT_MONTHLY_VW_CAP" and "F-F_Research_Data_5_Factors_2x3" by dates (July, 1963 - Decomber, 2024), which is used in our example.
-  The "R Implementation" file contains the R code that implements our approach.
